Human Activity Recognition for Practical Machine Learning
===========================

This report is bourne out of a data science course on Coursera.com through Johns Hopkins Univerity called Practical Machine Learning. The goal of the analysis is to create a prediction algorithm for the type of activity an individual is performing utilizing a set of human activity recognition data from the good folks at Groupware. The five distinct activities are sitting, sitting down, standing, standing up, and walking.

This is the repo for Coursera pml course project which builds a prediction model for distinguishing the activity of an individual wearing a human activity recognition device.
